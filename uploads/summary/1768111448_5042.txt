My Precept We always do hard work to get success. But to get success, we must have to know who we are? That kind of question, just roaming around my head. And my answer is I'm that type of guy who never gives up. I'm that guy who wants to bring peace all around the world. I'm that guy who wants to be creative and make others creative. I want to learn hard and write less with the full of meaning. You should never rest until your good is better and better is best.
