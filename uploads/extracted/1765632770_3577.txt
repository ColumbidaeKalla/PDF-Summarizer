My Precept
We always do hard work to get success. But to get
success, we must have to know who we are? and why
we are here? Well, I'm asking this question to myself.
That kind of question, just roaming around my head.
And my answer is I'm that type of guy who never
gives up. I'm that guy who wants to bring peace all
around the world. I'm that guy who wants to be
creative and make others creative. I want to learn
hard and write less with the full of meaning. I want
to make the inkpot empty by writing my critical
thought about our life.
I just want to tell you that "Know Yourself." Only
then you can understand the power you have to
bring change, no matter how small, to the world
around you. Do your best. Never give up. You might
get stock by other thoughts. Never get disappointed
by other's opinions. You have to have the ability to
take what people did and how they did it, forgive
them and move on. Don't try to humiliate others. And
don't get jealous of other's success cause you just
can't beat a person who never gives up. Do your
work. Just focus on what you did. Nothing is
impossible. Impossible itself is I'm impossible.
Everything always seems impossible until it's done.
So, try to do your best.

If you want to do some work, then you
must have to make a plan. Working
without a plan may seem scary. But
blindly following a plan that has no
relationship with reality is even scarier.
Don't ignore the small things cause a
very little key will open a very heavy
door. So, know yourself. The best way
to predict your future is to create new
things. Only after that, you can get
success in your life.
 At last, Perfection is achieved not
when there is nothing more to add. But
when there is nothing left to take
away. So, I just wanna tell you guys
that good, better, and best. You should
never rest until your good is better and
better is best.
